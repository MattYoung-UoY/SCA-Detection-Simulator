# Look at multiplying the num_samples from ch bound by constant factors from 1->0.5 (?)
# Take many distributions (keep them the same across trials?) and estimate the means
# At what num_samples * k do we stray outside the set parameters
    # ie. for eps = 0.1% and delta_p = 1%
    # when do we stray outside 1% difference more than 0.1% of the time?
# What sort of problem is this?
# A random bernoulli trial problem?
