# By blocking with a certain probability Eve can create probability distributions with means other than 0 or 1
# This would lower the entropy of the key, but not by as much as a constant block7ing
# How much information does this give to Eve, and can PA remove Eve's information here?
    # What is the lower bound on block probability
    # What distribution/mean value does that give arise to
    # What proportion of the key needs to be discarded
# If she blocked with a larger probability to gain more information, this would be detected faster
# Therefore amount discarded in lower bound case is the most that needs to be discarded
